## Description

- Welcome!
- I have created a weather html that not only gives you current weather data on the city you search, but also a 5 day forecast.
- If you would like to see the cities you have searched there is a stored history at the bottom of the input box.
- When you enter a city you will see and icon describing the weather condition, temperature, humidity, wind speed and the date. 


## Installation/Description

- Once you have entered your city it will display the current forecast on the top and five day forecast below.
